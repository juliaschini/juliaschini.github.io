	<h2> A little bit about me..... </h2>
	<p> Hi! My name is Julia Schini and I am originally from Minnetonka, Minnesota. Currently, I am a junior the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am studying Consumer Behavior and Marketplace Studies with certificates in Digital Studies, Entrepreneurship, and Business. I am passionate about brand marketing and thrive in developing clever social media mock-ups, presenting cohesive brand identities, and increasing consumer engagement.

I am especially drawn to fashion, beauty, and wellness spaces. Iâ€™m looking for hands-on experience and to learn from people within the industry to help grow my skills. </p>
